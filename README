       SetHandler   perl-script

     #

     my $ua  = LWP::UserAgent->new();
     my $req = HTTP::Request->new(GET => "http://example.com/foo/bar/baz.xml");

     $req->header("Range"  => qq(xmlns("x=http://example.com#")xpointer(*//x:thingy)));
     $req->header("Accept" => qq(application/xml));

     my $res = $ua->request($req);

DESCRIPTION
    Apache::XPointer is a mod_perl handler to address XML fragments using
    the HTTP 1.1 *Range* and *Accept* headers and the XPath scheme, as
    described in the paper : *A Semantic Web Resource Protocol: XPointer and
    HTTP*.

    Additionally, the handler may also be configured to recognize a
    conventional CGI parameter as a valid range identifier.

    If no 'range' property is found, then the original document is sent
    unaltered.

    If an *Accept* header is specified with no corresponding match, then the
    server will return (406) HTTP_NOT_ACCEPTABLE. Successful queries will
    return (206) HTTP_PARTIAL_CONTENT.

IMPORTANT
    This package is a base class and not expected to be invoked directly.
    Please use one of the scheme-specific handlers instead.
