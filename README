NAME
    Apache::XPointer - mod_perl handler to address XML fragments.

SYNOPSIS
     <Directory /foo/bar>

      <FilesMatch "\.xml$">
       SetHandler   perl-script
       PerlHandler  Apache::XPointer::XPath
      </FilesMatch>

     </Directory>

     #

     my $ua  = LWP::UserAgent->new();
     my $req = HTTP::Request->new(GET => "http://example.com/foo/bar/baz.xml");
     $req->header("Range" => qq(xmlns("x=x-urn:example")xpointer(*//x:thingy)));

     my $res = $ua->request($req);

DESCRIPTION
    Apache::XPointer is a mod_perl handler to address XML fragments using
    the HTTP 1.1 *Range* header, as described in the paper : *A Semantic Web
    Resource Protocol: XPointer and HTTP*.

    Additionally, the handler may also be configured to recognize a
    conventional CGI parameter as a valid range identifier.

    If no 'range' property is found, then the original document is sent
    unaltered.

IMPORTANT
    This package is a base class and not expected to be invoked directly.
    Please use one of the scheme-specific handlers instead.

MOD_PERL COMPATIBILITY
    This handler will work with both mod_perl 1.x and mod_perl 2.x; it works
    better in 1.x because it supports Apache::Request which does a better
    job of parsing CGI parameters.
